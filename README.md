# So Long Network

So Long Network is a multiplayer game inspired by the project "so_long" from School 42, with a twist of multiplayer functionality and a different graphics library. In So Long Network, players navigate through a maze-like environment filled with obstacles, collectibles, and enemies while competing against each other to reach the end goal.

It's a work in progress, with a lot to do and bugs to fix.
